# YOLO_V3 Object Detection using OpenCV

Here we are validating pre-trained YOLO_V3 over COCO Dataset with my custom image input.
The main objective of this project is to -
*	understand YOLO_V3 architecture.
*	Understand Non maximum suppression technique.
*	Getting knowlwdge on COCO dataset and its 80 class.
*	Work with YOLO_V3 without the entire darknet environment.
